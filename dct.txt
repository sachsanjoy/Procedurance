Sure, here's a Python script that uses the docx library to find striked text in a table inside a Word document:

python
Copy code
import docx

# open the Word document
doc = docx.Document('example.docx')

# iterate over all tables in the document
for table in doc.tables:
    # iterate over all cells in the table
    for row in table.rows:
        for cell in row.cells:
            # iterate over all paragraphs in the cell
            for paragraph in cell.paragraphs:
                # iterate over all runs in the paragraph
                for run in paragraph.runs:
                    # check if the run is struck through
                    if run.font.strike:
                        # print the text of the run
                        print(run.text)
