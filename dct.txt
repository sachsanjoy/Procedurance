Certainly, based on your survey data on people eating at quick service restaurants in the US and incorporating reported restaurant company metrics like revenue, retail data, and additional relevant metrics, here's a hypothesis you can consider:

"Hypothesis: There is a significant positive correlation between the revenue of quick service restaurants in the US and the following factors: 
1. Average customer satisfaction rating.
2. The number of menu items offered.
3. Average wait time for orders.
4. The percentage of orders placed via mobile apps or online platforms.
5. Monthly advertising spend on marketing campaigns.
6. The level of sustainability practices implemented in the restaurant's operations.

Furthermore, we hypothesize that these relationships extend to retail performance metrics, such as:
1. The number of franchise locations.
2. Average sales per square foot.
3. Employee turnover rates."

This hypothesis suggests that you believe there are correlations between the financial success of quick service restaurants and various customer satisfaction, operational, and marketing factors, as well as retail performance metrics. To test this hypothesis, you would need to gather and analyze data on all these variables to determine if there are indeed significant correlations.
