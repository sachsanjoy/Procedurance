Jupyter Notebook Tutorial Workshop Notebook
Introduction
Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is widely used by data scientists, researchers, and developers to explore, analyze, and communicate their work.

This tutorial workshop notebook is designed to give you a basic understanding of how to use Jupyter Notebook. We will cover the following topics:

Installation and setup
Creating and running a Jupyter Notebook
Working with cells
Markdown basics
Executing code
Saving and exporting notebooks
1. Installation and Setup
Before we can start using Jupyter Notebook, we need to install it. There are different ways to install Jupyter Notebook, but the easiest is through the Anaconda distribution. Anaconda is a popular Python distribution that comes with Jupyter Notebook pre-installed.

To install Anaconda, follow these steps:

Go to the Anaconda download page.
Download the appropriate version for your operating system.
Install Anaconda by following the prompts in the installation wizard.
Once you have installed Anaconda, you can launch Jupyter Notebook from the Anaconda Navigator or from the command line.

2. Creating and Running a Jupyter Notebook
To create a new Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

Launch Jupyter Notebook.
Click on the "New" button on the right-hand side of the screen.
Select "Python 3" to create a new notebook using Python.
You should now see a new notebook with a single empty cell.

To run a cell, click on it to select it and press "Shift + Enter". This will execute the code in the cell and display the output below the cell.

3. Working with Cells
Jupyter Notebook is organized into cells. Each cell can contain either code or markdown text. To add a new cell, click on the "+" button on the toolbar.

To change the type of a cell, select it and click on the drop-down menu on the toolbar. You can choose between "Code" and "Markdown".

To delete a cell, select it and press the "Delete" key.

4. Markdown Basics
Markdown is a simple markup language that allows you to format text in Jupyter Notebook. It is used to create headings, lists, links, and other formatting elements.

To create a markdown cell, select a cell and change its type to "Markdown". You can then start writing markdown text in the cell.

Here are some basic markdown syntax examples:

markdown
Copy code
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

*Italic*
**Bold**
***Bold and Italic***

- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3

5. Executing Code
Jupyter Notebook allows you to execute code in cells. To execute a code cell, select it and press "Shift + Enter". The output of the code will be displayed below the cell.

Here is an example of a simple Python code cell:

python
Copy code
# This is a Python code cell
a = 2
b = 3
print(a + b)
6. Saving and Exporting Notebooks
To save a Jupyter Notebook, click on the "Save" button on the toolbar. The notebook will be saved with a .ipynb extension.

To export a Jupyter Notebook, click on the "File" menu and select "
