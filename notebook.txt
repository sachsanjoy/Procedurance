Colleague Farewell Tribute

Write a short poem about a colleague leaving the company. Who was very kind used to wake up early to attend meetings from different timezones. Every Monday the first thing to do do is the usual survey. Thank him for supporting the projects.

A colleague bids farewell,
A chapter now complete.
Always kind and dutiful,
No task was ever too petite.

Mornings early, he would rise
To join us from afar.
Timezones may have differed,
But his dedication was on par.

On Mondays, as we'd gather,
The first task of the day.
He'd lead the usual survey,
In his calm and cheerful way.

We'll miss his steady presence,
And the support he'd provide.
Thank you for all you've done,
As we bid you a fond goodbye.

Try to fit it into a coffee mug so make it short

A kind colleague, now farewell,
Up early for meetings from afar.
Monday surveys he'd always lead,
Supporting projects like a shining star.

Thanks for all, we'll miss you so,
A mug of coffee to toast and go.

Not good stick with the first one. Add good luck on his next journey 

A colleague bids farewell,
Kind and punctual, always there to tell,
From different timezones he'd arise,
Supporting projects with passion in his eyes.

Monday surveys were his forte,
Starting the week in an efficient way.
Now he leaves, we'll miss him dearly,
But wish him good luck on his journey.

Thank you for your dedication,
And the memories we'll cherish.
May your future endeavors bring success,
As you embark on a new cherish.

A colleague leaves, a friend departs,
A kindred soul with many hearts.
Waking early for calls so bright,
To make sure things went alright.

On Mondays, he'd lead the way,
The survey done before the day.
Supporting projects with great care,
His presence felt beyond compare.

Thank you for your loyal support,
For being there with good rapport.
We'll miss you dearly, that's for sure,
But wish you well and so much more.

As you move on to new frontiers,
Take with you our warmest cheers.
May you find success in all you do,
And know you'll be missed by all of us too.

He used to work with legends too,
A team player, through and through.
