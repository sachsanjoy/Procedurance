    "# Welcome to the NumPy Workshop!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a powerful library for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of mathematical operations to manipulate them. In this workshop, we'll be covering some of the basics of NumPy, but don't worry, it won't be too square!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive in, let's import NumPy and give it a nickname for easier typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're ready to rock and roll!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a NumPy array, we can simply pass a Python list to the np.array() function. Let's create an array of integers:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "print(my_array)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "[1 2 3 4 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Wow, that was easy peasy lemon squeezy!\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we want to create an array of floats instead? Easy cheesy!\n",
    "\n",
    "my_float_array = np.array([1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5])\n",
    "print(my_float_array)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "[1.1 2.2 3.3 4.4 5.5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're cooking with gas!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Array Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the great things about NumPy is that it provides a wide range of mathematical operations to manipulate arrays. Let's take a look at some of the most common ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addition\n",
    "\n",
    "To add two arrays together, we can simply use the + operator. Let's create two arrays and add them together:\n",
    "\n",
    "array_1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "array_2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])\n",
    "array_sum = array_1 + array_2\n",
    "print(array_sum)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "[5 7 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subtraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Subtracting arrays is just as easy. Let's subtract array_2 from array_1:\n",
    "\n",
    "array_diff = array_1 - array_2\n",
    "print(array_diff)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "[-3 -3 -3]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "To multiply two arrays together, we can use the * operator. Let's create two arrays and multiply them together:\n",
    "\n",
    "array_3 = np.array([2, 4, 6])\n",
    "array_4 = np.array([1, 3, 5])\n",
    "array_product = array_3 * array_4\n",
    "print(array_product)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "[ 2 12 30]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Division\n",
    "\n",
    "Dividing arrays is a piece of cake. Let's divide array_3 by array_4:\n",
    "\n",
    "array_quotient = array_3 / array_4\n",
    "print(array_quotient)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "[2.         1.33333333 1.2       ]\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy sure knows how to divide and conquer!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's a wrap! We hope you've enjoyed this workshop on NumPy. Remember, if you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask. We're always here to lend a helping hand. Keep calm and NumPy on! ðŸ§®ðŸ¤–\n"
